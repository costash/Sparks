This project will follow some coding style rules as follows.

For referrence use the link:
http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html

0) File content must be kept within 80 columns!

00) Use TAB for indentation, not spaces.

1) Names representing types must be in mixed case starting with upper case.
    e.g.: Line, SavingsAccount

2) Variable names must be in mixed case starting with lower case.
    e.g.: line, savingsAccount

3) Named constants (including enumeration values) must be all uppercase 
using underscore to separate words.
    e.g.: MAX_ITERATIONS, COLOR_RED, PI

4)  Names representing methods or functions must be verbs and written in 
mixed case starting with lower case.
    e.g.: getName(), computerTotalWidth()

5) Names representing namespaces should be all lowercase.
    e.g.: model::analyzer, io::iomanager, common::math::geometry

6) Names representing template types should be a single uppercase letter.
    e.g.:   template<class T> ...
            template<class C, class D> ...

7) Use comments wth /** */ before class or functions description
    e.g.:
    /** 
     * Description for MyClsas
     * on many lines
     */
    class MyClass
    {
        ...
    }

8) For classes and functions use the above layout and for other blocks use
a layout like in the following example:
    // Next is a block of code
    if (condition) {
        statements;
    }
    else if (condition) {
        statements;
    }

    // The same for loops (while, for, do-while)
    for (init; condition; update) {
        statements;
    }

Have a nice code!
